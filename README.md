## Quorum
This project is built with Vagrant on a virtual private server using a Quorum network and developing an application by modifying Quorumâ€™s 7Nodes example which consists 7 nodes and 7 transaction managers.

In your server, open a terminal and clone the 7Nodes example:

```
git clone https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples
```

After clonning process is completed, enter the directory and start Vagrant deployment:
